# Switch to Live Trading Guide üöÄ

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Read This First!

You have **~22-24 USDT** (‚Çπ2,000). This is a **small amount** for testing.

**Expectations:**
- Good for learning and testing
- Expect 2-5 trades max at a time
- Profit/loss will be small (‚Çπ50-200 per trade)
- Perfect for gaining experience

## üîë Step 1: Enable Trading on API Key

### **If You Have KYC Verified:**

1. **Go to API Management:**
   ```
   Binance.com ‚Üí Profile ‚Üí API Management
   ```

2. **Click "Edit" on your API key**

3. **Enable these permissions:**
   ```
   ‚úÖ Enable Reading
   ‚úÖ Enable Spot & Margin Trading ‚Üê ENABLE THIS!
   ‚ùå Enable Futures (leave OFF)
   ‚ùå Enable Withdrawals (NEVER enable!)
   ```

4. **Save changes**

5. **Complete security verification** (2FA code)

### **If You DON'T Have KYC:**

**You must complete KYC first to enable trading:**

1. Go to: https://www.binance.com/en/my/settings/profile
2. Click "Verify" under Identification
3. Upload Aadhaar/PAN card
4. Complete face verification
5. Wait for approval (10 mins - 24 hours)
6. Then enable trading on API key

**Without KYC, you cannot use API for live trading!**

## üí∞ Step 2: Transfer USDT to Spot Wallet

Your USDT is probably in **P2P Wallet** - needs to be in **Spot Wallet** for trading!

### **How to Transfer:**

1. **Go to Wallet:**
   ```
   Binance ‚Üí Wallet ‚Üí Fiat and Spot
   ```

2. **Click "Transfer"**

3. **Set transfer:**
   ```
   From: P2P Wallet
   To: Spot Wallet
   Coin: USDT
   Amount: [Your amount, e.g., 23 USDT]
   ```

4. **Click "Confirm Transfer"**

5. **Verify:** Check Spot Wallet has USDT

## ‚öôÔ∏è Step 3: Configure Bot for Small Capital

With only ~23 USDT, you need to adjust settings for smaller trades.

### **Edit Your Bot Configuration:**

Open `.env` file:
```bash
notepad .env
```

**Add/modify these lines:**

```bash
# Switch to LIVE mode
TRADING_MODE=live

# Smaller position sizes for low capital
# With 23 USDT, use 30-40% per position = ~7-9 USDT per trade
```

**Save and close.**

### **Edit config.py for Small Capital:**

We need to reduce position sizes since you have limited capital.

Open `config.py` and change line 56-60 to:

```python
# Small capital settings (for ~20-50 USDT)
POSITION_SIZE_PCT = 0.30  # 30% per position instead of 15%
STOP_LOSS_PCT = 0.03      # 3% stop loss (tighter)
TAKE_PROFIT_PCT = 0.08    # 8% take profit (quicker)
MAX_POSITIONS = 2         # Max 2 positions (instead of 5)
TRADING_CYCLE_MINUTES = 10 # Every 10 minutes (more conservative)
```

**Why these changes?**
- **30% per position** = ~7 USDT per trade (minimum needed)
- **Max 2 positions** = Can open 2 trades max
- **Tighter stops** = Protect small capital
- **10-min cycles** = Less frequent, more careful

## üéØ Step 4: Start Live Trading

### **Option A: Via Dashboard (Recommended)**

```bash
python app.py
```

1. Open: http://localhost:5000
2. Click **"Start Bot"**
3. Monitor the dashboard
4. Watch for real trades!

### **Option B: Via Command Line**

```bash
python run_bot.py
```

Watch the logs for trade execution.

## üìä What to Expect with 23 USDT

### **Trading Capacity:**
- **Per trade:** ~7 USDT (‚Çπ600)
- **Max positions:** 2 trades at once
- **Total deployed:** ~14 USDT when fully invested

### **Example Trades:**
```
Trade 1: BUY 0.0001 BTC @ $67,000 = ~7 USDT
Trade 2: BUY 0.003 ETH @ $2,600 = ~7 USDT

```

### **Expected Profits (Per Trade):**

- **3% loss:** -‚Çπ18 loss (‚Çπ600 √ó 3%)
- **Daily target:** ‚Çπ50-150 (realistic)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risk Management for Small Capital

- ‚úÖ Start with 1-2 trades only

### **Don't's:**

## üîç Step 5: Verify Live Trading is Working

### **Check 1: Bot Status**
Dashboard should show:
```
Status: Running
Mode: LIVE ‚Üê Important!
Capital: ~23 USDT
Positions: 0-2
```

### **Check 2: Binance Wallet**
Check your Spot Wallet:
- USDT decreases when buying
- BTC/ETH/SOL increases
- Real orders in "Spot Orders"

### **Check 3: Bot Logs**
You should see:
```
LIVE TRADING MODE ENABLED
BUY BTC/USDT - Amount: 0.0001 @ $67,234.50
Order executed on Binance
```

## üìà Growing Your Capital

### **First Week Goals:**

## üí° Pro Tips for Small Capital

1. **Be Patient:** Don't expect daily profits

4. **Stay Realistic:** ‚Çπ2,000 won't make you rich overnight
5. **Compound:** Reinvest profits to grow capital

## üìû Troubleshooting

### **"Insufficient balance" error:**
- Position size too large
- Reduce `POSITION_SIZE_PCT` to 0.25 (25%)
