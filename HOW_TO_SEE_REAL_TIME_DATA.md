### **"I still don't see any data"**

- If empty, refresh page and click "Start Bot" again

**Check 3:** Check browser console
- Press `F12`
- Click "Console" tab
- Look for any red errors

**Check 4:** Is the bot actually running?

## 🚀 Advanced: Force Bot to Trade Faster

Want to see trades happen immediately? Here's how:

### **Option 1: Lower Confidence Threshold**

Edit `config.py`:
```python
PREDICTION_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD = 0.35  # Was 0.55, now MUCH lower
```

This makes the bot trade more aggressively!

### **Option 2: Faster Trading Cycles**

Edit `config.py`:
```python
TRADING_CYCLE_MINUTES = 1  # Was 5, now every 1 minute!
```

### **Option 3: More Aggressive Signals**

Edit `src/simple_trading_bot.py`:
```python
# Line 58: Change from "if buy_signals >= 2:" to:
if buy_signals >= 1:  # Trade with just 1 signal!
```

**⚠️ Warning:** These changes make the bot trade A LOT! Use only for testing!

1. **Keep the logs section visible** - This is your window into the bot's "brain"
2. **Wait 5-10 minutes** for first trade - Good trading takes patience
3. **Watch the chart** - It's more satisfying than numbers
4. **Refresh data manually** - Click blue "Refresh" button if needed
