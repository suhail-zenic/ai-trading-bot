# Bot Stuck Issue - Fixes Applied

## Issues Identified

Your trading bot got stuck overnight due to several critical issues:

### 1. **Exchange Initialization Hang**
- The `load_markets()` call in the exchange initialization could hang indefinitely
- No timeout protection on the initial connection test
- **Impact**: Bot would freeze during startup before any logs were written

### 2. **API Call Timeouts**
- No retry logic for failed API calls
- No specific handling for network errors or rate limit exceptions
- **Impact**: A single failed API call could cause the entire cycle to fail or hang

### 3. **Missing Heartbeat Mechanism**
- No way to detect if the bot was alive or stuck
- No monitoring of bot health
- **Impact**: Impossible to tell if bot was working or frozen

### 4. **Poor Error Recovery**
- Trading cycles didn't have timeout protection
- Errors in one cycle could cascade to the next
- **Impact**: One error could break the entire bot

### 5. **Logging Issues**
- Logs weren't flushed immediately
- Could lose log data if bot crashed
- **Impact**: Empty log file despite bot running

## Fixes Applied

### ✅ Exchange Connection (data_fetcher.py)
```python
# Before: Could hang indefinitely on load_markets()
exchange.load_markets()

# After: Fast ticker test with proper error handling
ticker = exchange.fetch_ticker('BTC/USDT')
if ticker and 'last' in ticker:
    return exchange
```
- Increased timeout to 15 seconds
- Added receive window configuration
- Faster connection testing

### ✅ Retry Logic & Error Handling (data_fetcher.py)
```python
# Added automatic retry for network errors
for attempt in range(retries + 1):
    try:
        ohlcv = self.exchange.fetch_ohlcv(...)
        return df
    except ccxt.NetworkError as e:
        # Retry with delay
        time.sleep(2)
    except ccxt.RateLimitExceeded as e:
        # Wait longer for rate limits
        time.sleep(5)
```
- Handles network errors gracefully
- Respects rate limits
- Returns empty DataFrame instead of crashing

### ✅ Cycle Timeout Protection (simple_trading_bot.py)
```python
# Added 5-minute timeout per cycle
signal.signal(signal.SIGALRM, timeout_handler)
signal.alarm(300)  # 5 minutes max per cycle
```
- Prevents cycles from hanging forever
- Automatically skips to next cycle if timeout occurs
- Logs timeout events for debugging

### ✅ Heartbeat Monitoring (simple_trading_bot.py)
```python
# Track bot health
self.last_heartbeat = datetime.now()

# In get_status():
time_since_heartbeat = (datetime.now() - self.last_heartbeat).total_seconds()
is_healthy = time_since_heartbeat < 600  # 10 minutes
```
- Updates heartbeat after each successful cycle
- Exposes health status via API
- Can detect if bot is stuck

### ✅ Improved Logging (simple_trading_bot.py)
```python
# Force immediate log flushing
logging.basicConfig(...)
for handler in logging.root.handlers:
    handler.flush()
```
- Logs are written immediately
- Line buffering enabled
- Logs flushed after each cycle

### ✅ Better Error Recovery (simple_trading_bot.py)
```python
# Sleep in smaller intervals for responsive shutdown
while elapsed < sleep_time and self.running:
    time.sleep(min(10, sleep_time - elapsed))
    elapsed += 10
```
- Can stop bot more quickly
- Continues even if cycles fail
- Detailed error logging with stack traces

## How to Monitor Your Bot

### 1. Check Logs in Real-Time
```bash
# Windows PowerShell
Get-Content trading_bot.log -Wait -Tail 50

# Or use the dashboard
python app.py
# Visit http://localhost:5000
```

### 2. Monitor Bot Health
The dashboard now shows:
- ✅ `is_healthy`: Whether bot is responding
- ⏰ `last_heartbeat`: Time of last successful cycle
- ⏱️ `seconds_since_heartbeat`: How long since last activity

### 3. Check Cycle Progress
Logs now show:
```
=== TRADING CYCLE - 2025-10-24 10:30:00 ===
Checking existing positions for SL/TP...
No open positions to check
Analyzing 3 trading pairs...
BTC/USDT: Signal=HOLD, Price=$67234.50, RSI=52.3
ETH/USDT: Signal=HOLD, Price=$2634.21, RSI=48.7
SOL/USDT: Signal=BUY, Price=$165.32, RSI=38.2
BUY SOL/USDT - Amount: 9.0716 @ $165.32 | SL: $158.70 | TP: $181.85
Portfolio: $10000.00 | Profit: $0.00 (0.00%) | Positions: 1
=== CYCLE COMPLETE ===
```

### 4. Warning Signs to Watch For
🚨 **Bot might be stuck if you see:**
- No log entries for > 10 minutes
- `is_healthy: false` in status
- Same cycle number repeating
- "Network error" messages repeatedly
- "Rate limit exceeded" without recovery

## Recommendations

### For Overnight Running:
1. **Start in the morning** - Verify it runs for 1-2 hours first
2. **Check logs regularly** - Use `Get-Content trading_bot.log -Wait -Tail 50`
3. **Monitor dashboard** - Keep it open in a browser tab
4. **Set alerts** - Use the health check endpoint

### Configuration Adjustments:
```python
# In config.py - Make these changes for more stability:

TRADING_CYCLE_MINUTES = 10  # Increase from 5 to reduce API calls
POSITION_SIZE_PCT = 0.10    # Reduce from 0.15 for less risk
MAX_POSITIONS = 3            # Reduce from 5 for simpler tracking
```

### API Rate Limits:
- Binance: ~1200 requests/minute (weight-based)
- Bot makes ~10-20 requests per cycle
- Current config: Safe for unlimited running

## Testing the Fixes

Run this quick test:
```bash
python test_bot_health.py
```

This will:
1. ✅ Test exchange connection
2. ✅ Verify data fetching works
3. ✅ Run one trading cycle
4. ✅ Check heartbeat updates
5. ✅ Verify logging works

## If Bot Gets Stuck Again

1. **Check the log file** - Last entry will show where it stuck
2. **Note the timestamp** - Calculate how long it's been stuck
3. **Check your internet** - Run `ping binance.com`
4. **Restart the bot** - Stop and start fresh
5. **Report the issue** - Include last 50 log lines

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Test the bot for 30 minutes
2. ✅ Verify logs are being written
3. ✅ Check dashboard shows healthy status
4. ✅ Monitor for 2-3 hours before leaving overnight
5. ✅ Consider reducing trading frequency if issues persist

---

**Note**: The fixes prioritize stability over aggressive trading. If the bot detects issues, it will:
- Skip problematic symbols
- Wait and retry on errors  
- Continue running even if individual cycles fail
- Log everything for debugging

Your bot should now be much more resilient and won't get stuck like before! 🚀
